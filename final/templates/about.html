                Our team dedicate ourselves to creating interactive games and bring happiness as well as fun facts to players.
                We are glad that we can utilize what we've learnt in class such as arithemetic, lists, and iterations into real application.
                We also learnt something outside of class by completing this project, such as how to adjust different fonts, styles, and background for html,
                how to use url_for to put variable into html and jump to relevant link, how to use strip and split function to eliminate the spaces of a string,
                how to write if statement in jinjia to return different pictures, and so on.
