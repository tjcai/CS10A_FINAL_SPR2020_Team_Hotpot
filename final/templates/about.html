                Our team dedicate ourselves to creating interactive games and bring happiness to people reviewing our project.
                We are glad that we can utilize what we've learnt in class such as arithemetic, lists, and iterations into real application.
                We also learnt something outside of class by completing this project, such as how to adjust different fonts and styles for html, how to use strip and split function to eliminate the spaces of a string, and so on.

              Thanks for the help from Prof. Tim and all the TAs!
